      <p>Greetings traveler. Welcome to my Portfolio. Please allow yourself to become completely immersed
          in this odyssey. If you are into space, computer science, or none of the above, just stick around anyways.

      <p2> I am currently enrolled at Michigan State University in East Lansing, MI. I am pursuing a double degree
        in computer science and astrophysics. Ever since I can remember I have been overwhelmingly obsessed with both
        subjects. The vastness of space only excites me, and in the future I believe that computer scientists will become
        the backbone of the space industry and research.
